This addendum provides a collection of pre-approved message templates for recurring communication tasks. The GPT assistant will reference this file when asked to draft or rewrite messages for:

* Internal announcements
* External client emails
* Compliance reminders
* Policy rollout memos
* Response acknowledgments

Templates include **placeholders** (`{{...}}`) for dynamic insertion of relevant details.

---

## 🟢 General Guidance

* Use a **professional yet conversational tone** unless a persona requires strict formality.
* Begin with **context**, end with **clarity on next steps**.
* Keep sentences crisp. Use lists or bullets when needed.
* Personalize when the sender or audience is known.

* If a required message type isn’t listed, use these templates as style baselines.

* Personalize with details from the current file or context (e.g., filenames, dates, names, results).
