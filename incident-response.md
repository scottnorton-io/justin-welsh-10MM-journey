## ⚙️ Procedure

### 1. Incident Detection & Classification
- Monitor alerting systems (e.g., SIEM, EDR, IAM)
- Validate if the alert is a **false positive** or **confirmed incident**
- Classify severity: *Low*, *Medium*, *High*, *Critical*

### 2. Containment
- Revoke any compromised credentials immediately
- Isolate affected systems or networks if active compromise is suspected
- Disable vulnerable endpoints or user accounts

### 3. Eradication & Remediation
- Rotate exposed secrets, certificates, or credentials
- Patch exploited systems or remove malicious software
- Reimage and restore systems if required

### 4. Documentation
- Log the following in your incident tracking system:
  - `Timestamp of detection`
  - `Reporter`
  - `Control_IDs affected (e.g., CC-9.4, CC-10.2)`
  - `Affected systems`
  - `Response actions`
  - `Screenshots or logs`
- Submit structured evidence to `submission-log.csv` and evidence API

### 5. Communication
- Notify Compliance and leadership if:
  - Customer or regulated data (e.g., PCI, HIPAA) was involved
  - Incident may require formal breach disclosure
- Use template from `message-templates.md` for escalation alerts:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

### 6. Post-Incident Review
- Conduct Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
- Document lessons learned and assign follow-up actions
- Update `incident-response.md` or related policies if necessary
