## üìÅ llms.txt ‚Äì Large Language Model System Instruction

---

**Purpose**:
The file `llms.txt` defines operational context for human collaborators working with the GPT Project Instruction. It aligns AI behavior with intended workflows and prevents misuse or misinterpretation.

### üéØ Assistant Use Policy

This GPT assistant:

* Relies on flat files for memory; it **cannot remember prior sessions** unless the file history is uploaded again.
* Should be used like a **consultant with static reference material** ‚Äî not a conversational partner.
* Works best when files are versioned, labeled, and structured.
* Supports **modular project execution**, not open-ended ideation.

---

### üß± File System Best Practices

To maximize effectiveness:

* Limit total files to 20, max 20MB each.
* Use **clear filenames** like `2025-04-15_pci-dss-matrix.csv` or `brand-guide_v1.2.md`.
* Use **section headers** and **metadata inside files** to support GPT‚Äôs navigation.
* When updating a document, use versioning: `docname_v1.md`, `docname_v2.md`.

### üß† When to Use Addendums

Addendums should be created when:

* The topic is too detailed for a prompt (e.g., a full compliance checklist).
* Reuse across multiple sessions or projects is needed.
* Standard reference material (e.g., a template, policy, or library) is involved.
* A recurring structure (e.g., JSON spec or business model) is required.

### üìö Recommended Addendums to Write

Here are recommended addendums to support the GPT assistant in this execution environment:

| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `project-overview.md`      | High-level summary of the project, goals, and background context.    |
| `compliance-checklist.csv` | Structured requirements checklist (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, etc.)       |
| `user-personas.md`         | Defined personas or roles the assistant should consider in outputs.  |
