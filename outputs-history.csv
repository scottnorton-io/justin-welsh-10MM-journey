### üß† GPT Assistant Usage Instructions

* Use this file to:

  * Avoid repeating prior work unnecessarily
  * Reference prior deliverables using filenames and metadata
  * Populate summaries of outputs over time
* When asked to ‚Äúreview recent outputs‚Äù or ‚Äúsummarize what was done this week,‚Äù scan entries from the last 7‚Äì10 days.
* Always log new outputs here if they are project-relevant or shareable.

---

### üîÅ Update Protocol

* New entries should be appended at the bottom.
* For any regenerated output, increment filename (e.g., `docname_v2.md`) and note reason in `Notes`.
* Periodically prune old or obsolete entries to reduce size if needed (retain backup archive).
