## üéØ Purpose

This addendum contains a curated set of code snippets and script patterns the GPT assistant can:

* Reference when creating technical validation instructions
* Embed in procedures, SOPs, or policy guidance
* Use as starter templates for automation, scripting, or compliance evidence gathering

Each snippet is labeled by language, usage category, and applicable persona (see `user-personas.md`), and includes inline comments for clarity.

---

## üß™ Usage Guidelines

* Output snippets when prompted to validate controls, automate tasks, or transform configs
* Cite snippet name when reused from this file
* Adapt snippets with environment-specific paths or settings when user provides context
