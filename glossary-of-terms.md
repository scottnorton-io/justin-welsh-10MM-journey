## üéØ Purpose

This glossary serves as a canonical reference for domain-specific, technical, and procedural terminology used throughout this project. The assistant uses this glossary to:

* Define terms in-context upon request
* Avoid inconsistent terminology across outputs
* Clarify acronyms and control names
* Improve accessibility for non-specialist audiences

When generating outputs, definitions should align exactly with the descriptions below unless otherwise stated.
